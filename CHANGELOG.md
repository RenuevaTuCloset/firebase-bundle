# CHANGELOG

## [Unreleased]

## [2.3.0] - 2020-10-04
### Added
* PHP `^8.0` is now an allowed (but untested) PHP version

## [2.2.0] - 2020-07-10
### Added
* It is now possible to log HTTP requests and responses to the Firebase APIs 
  by specifying a logger's service ID. You can do so by setting 
  `http_request_logger` and `http_request_debug_logger` with the service ID 
  of an already configured logger, e.g. `monolog.logger`.

## [2.1.0] - 2020-06-23
### Added
* Added Support for PSR-6 and PSR-16 caches. This implicitly adds
  out-of-the-box support for Symfony 5.
### Changed
* The bundle now requires a version `^5.5` of the Firebase Admin SDK.
* The default branch of the GitHub repository has been renamed from `master`
  to `main` - if you're using `dev-master` as a version constraint in your 
  `composer.json`, please update it to `dev-main`.

## [2.0.0] - 2020-04-01
### Added
* Added Support for `kreait/firebase-php:^5.0`
### Removed
* Removed Support for `kreait/firebase-php:<5.0`
* Removed project aliases
